As part of the [Trust Project Challenge](http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/trust-project-challenge/), we developed a tool to be a better media sceptic. 

Please see our [website](https://dpa-newslab.github.io/ajda) for details.

This repository contains the project website (branch [gh-pages](https://github.com/dpa-newslab/ajda/tree/gh-pages)) and sample code for the three functions in the master branch:

  - ex-ray Expert scrutiny, looking for quotations from sources

  - language - clarifying journo jargon for the news consumer

  - out-of-bubble - presenting "the other view"
