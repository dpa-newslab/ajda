title: What we used
---

As everybody else, we do stand on the shoulders of giants. Here's the kudos to the work we rely on:

  - [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) their persistent effort to bring an annotation layer to the web makes it possible to focus on the functionality behind the scenes and stop worrying about delivery.
  - [TXTWerk](http://txtwerk.de/) - Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation and Linked Open Data augmentation together with [the Stanford POS tagger](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml) for the first step of the source background check
  - [The Juicer](http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/juicer/), the BBC News Lab's succulent linked-data aware news index that does the heavy lifting of the source background check.
  - [Project Mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) for the nice markdowny diagram.
