Martin Schulz stepped up to the microphone to announce his departure from Brussels on Thursday, he looked strong and determined. Inside, though, as quickly became apparent, melancholy was the dominant emotion. He seemed short of breath as he spoke, as though taking his leave was a strenuous undertaking. Then, he took a deep breath and said: \"It was not an easy decision.\"\n\nThough there are many sentences uttered in the world of politics that are staged or filled with ulterior motives, this one smacks of honesty. As corny as it may sound, Schulz's devotion to Europe is heartfelt -- even if it may have looked in recent weeks, as he fought to save his job as president of the European Parliament, that his primary concern was his own posting.\n\nSchulz grew up in the border area between Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands and has relatives in all three countries. As a child, he listened to stories told by his grandfather about how he had to fight in World War I against his cousins in Belgium and the Netherlands. As he announced his move to Berlin, he also hailed European unification as being civilization's greatest achievement over the past century. There is hardly any other German politician who has conducted politics at the European level as passionately as Schulz has over the past 22 years.\n\nThe hour of departure could also mark a fresh start. For now, however, Schulz's political future is uncertain. When he took the post as president of the European Parliament, part of the deal was that he would step down before the end of his term. A debate has been underway in Brussels over whether to allow him to stay in office, but it is one he believes he no longer has any realistic chance of winning. So he felt he needed to announce his departure at a point when it still appeared to be at least partly voluntary. As he made his Thursday announcement, though, he wasn't at all sure what his political future would hold.\n\nIn recent weeks, Schulz's name has been suggested for a number of top posts within his center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). It has been suggested he could potentially become the head of the party, its chancellor candidate or perhaps even foreign minister once Frank-Walter Steinmeier, likewise a senior SPD member, leaves the post to become German president. The only way he could land one of these posts, though, is through his years-long friend Sigmar Gabriel, who heads the SPD and serves as Germany's economics minister. But Gabriel has so far been vague, which raises questions about just how reliable that friendship still is.\n\nThe only thing that's certain is that Schulz has been guaranteed a position as the party's leading candidate in federal parliamentary elections next year for the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, which virtually assures him a seat in the Bundestag. And that move will bring one of Germany's most spirited and engaged politicians from Brussels to Berlin -- but one who remains largely unknown to many in his home country.\n\nFor a man who was a serious alcoholic at the age of 24 and was close to committing suicide, Schulz has come a very long way. During the intensive therapy he underwent after his breakdown, he learned that one of his most dangerous weaknesses was that of setting goals that were too high -- and that he tends toward an overestimation of his own abilities.\n\nIn his youth, Schulz played on the football team in his hometown of Würselen, a suburb of Aachen. For years, he dreamed of one day becoming a professional player. Schulz was good at the sport, but not amazing and a serious knee injury abruptly brought that dream to an end. Looking back, he would later admit he had been overconfident about his pro-football dreams and that the goal hadn't been realistic. That's one of the reasons he descended into alcohol. Over the years, though, Schulz developed a pretty good feel for what he can achieve. He constantly questions himself, even moreso recently given the scope of the potential new tasks that may be on the horizon.\n\nHe has no doubts he could tackle the foreign minister job. If he becomes Steinmeier's successor, he would become one of the most qualified and experienced German politicians ever to take the job. In addition to having a solid understanding of global affairs, Schulz also knows many important institutional leaders and elected officials around the world. When it comes to European politics, he is perhaps even better networked than Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"When you've been a part of Europe as long as I have, then you know everybody,\" he once said.\n\nAs president of European Parliament, Schulz proved extremely adept at delicate diplomatic missions, such as his visit with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in September following last summer's coup attempt and his visit with Iranian President Hassan Rohani in November 2015 to \"intensify dialogue\" between the EU and Iran a few months after the signing of the nuclear deal. Schulz is fluent in five foreign languages. His advisors believe the area that holds the greatest risk for Schulz is his tendency toward overly direct and at times flippant remarks. One has to know him extremely well not to get offended when he uses expressions like, \"egg head,\" \"sleepyhead\" or \"dumbass.\"\n\nOver the summer, Schulz only tentatively addressed the question as to whether he might enter the ring as the SPD's chancellor candidate. The only reason those rumors even arose is that Gabriel's own stalling opened up room for speculation that he might not choose to run this time. Schulz began asking himself critical questions, knowing that if he wasn't absolutely devoted to the campaign, voters would notice. By the end of this process, he had decided that he would in fact run if Gabriel asked him to do so. Weeks have since passed and now it appears that his willingness to run has transformed into an active desire.\n\nParadoxically, the fact that many Germans are unfamiliar with him could actually make him an attractive candidate. After 11 years at the country's helm, Germans have become extremely familiar with Chancellor Merkel. Voters and journalists alike also appear to have passed judgment on Gabriel, and it is not a positive one. It may sound unfair, but it is unrealistic to think that voters would be willing to take a fresh look at Gabriel. With Schulz, on the other hand, very few Germans have actually developed a full opinion about the politician. At the very least, there would be room for surprise in a Schulz candidacy.\n\nThe actual role Schulz will assume when he comes to Berlin is now dependent on a man who Schulz staunchly refers to as a friend. Now, though, their respective ambitions are standing in each other's way and casting a shadow over their friendship. Over the summer, they agreed that one of the pair had to become the candidate, an oath taken by two lone wolves in their party who both rose out of modest upbringings. They even identified the potential areas of concern for a Gabriel candidacy and for a Schulz candidacy.\n\nBut it was followed by a tussle over the CETA negotiations, the free trade agreement between the EU and Canada. Schulz pushed hard for CETA and met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa, securing additional concessions and talks with him. He arranged for a delegation of SPD politicians to travel to Canada to negotiate a further concession in advance of a delicate party convention. But Gabriel surprised everyone by cancelling the trip at the last minute. The move infuriated Schulz. \"I'm not doing anything more on Canada and CETA,\" he said at the time. Ultimately, he did continue fighting and CETA was approved in the end, but the tensions between Schulz and Gabriel were mounting.\n\nEven though Gabriel celebrated CETA and other political successes, new polls weighed heavily on him emotionally -- mostly measures of his political popularity showing that he would stand virtually no chance against Merkel in a run for the Chancellery. At the same time, his friend Martin Schulz saw his own popularity ratings rise. These figures changed something in the relationship between the two. They boosted Schulz's conviction that he would be the better candidate, but they also instilled a sense of distrust in Gabriel.\n\nParty chair Gabriel also registered the fact that Schulz was becoming less willing to talk of a run for the Chancellery without becoming the SPD's new leader at the same time. If Gabriel had thought he could allow Schulz to become the SPD's chancellor candidate while retaining the party chair, he was mistaken. By this point, the unwanted rivalry between the two had developed an existential element. In early October, SPIEGEL reported that the mood in the party was turning against Gabriel and that Schulz was gaining supporters. Schulz took note of the article with satisfaction, but it wasn't as well received by Gabriel.\n\nAbout six weeks ago, cracks in the friendship also became visible to the public. For two days, Schulz toured through Berlin, rushing from one public appearance. He accepted an award and then attended a book launch party -- of the first biography to be written about him.\n\nGabriel wasn't pleased by Schulz's self-promotion. He began calling Schulz less frequently and became more suspicious and irritable. \"He's waging a campaign against me,\" he confided to one of his advisors. Schulz also sensed things had changed. \"He doesn't want me in Berlin,\" he complained to people close to him.\n\nThe tensions continued even after Steinmeier was declared the candidate to become Germany's president, a largely symbolic role, in mid-November. On that Monday morning, Gabriel had appeared euphoric at a meeting of the party's national executive. Schulz also should have been in a good mood -- after all, the Foreign Ministry post, a job that had long been appealing to him, had opened up. But Schulz wasn't in positive spirits. Later it emerged why.\n\nGabriel had been giving serious consideration not only to running for chancellor, but also shifting from the Economics to the Foreign Ministry -- his logic being that he might be able to bolster his own popularity ratings in the more high-profile role of foreign minister. If he were to do that, nothing would be left for Schulz.\n\nThe two then made another attempt to restore the mutual trust in their relationship. The next day, Schulz again flew from Brussels to Berlin, where he and Gabriel wanted to meet at a hotel for a face-to-face. The two did speak, but the clarity Schulz had hoped to receive on the foreign minister and chancellor issues didn't materialize. And it apparently still hasn't.\n\nOn Monday, during another meeting of the national executive, Gabriel said there was no need to rush. He also once again compelled the party executive as well as the SPD's parliamentary group to stick with his schedule, which called for the nomination of the party's chancellor candidate only at the end of January. The new foreign minister, an office that is held by the SPD as part of its government coalition agreement with Chancellor Merkel's conservatives, would also not be named until then.\n\nMost SPD leaders now assume that Gabriel will run against Merkel. After months of procrastinating, few believe he would be irresponsible enough to bow out at the last minute. If he hadn't intended to run himself, why would he have kept Schulz at bay for so long? And wouldn't his announcement this week that his wife is expecting a second child have provided him the perfect opportunity to decline a candidacy if that is what he intended?\n\nGabriel appears to be occupied at the moment with the question of which position would be a better one from which to challenge Merkel. As vice chancellor and economics minister, his current role? As SPD floor leader, so that he can be freed of the cabinet discipline that would prevent him from attacking Merkel more openly on the campaign trail? Or as Steinmeier's successor as foreign minister? The hope is that the office would give Gabriel a certain amount of gravitas and dignity. It's common in Germany for foreign ministers to see a spike in their popularity ratings. The only hitch is that Gabriel hasn't yet displayed a whole lot of talent when it comes to diplomacy. During the trips he has taken abroad so far, he's shown more of a knack for generating unwanted headlines.\n\nFrom Martin Schulz's perspective, it would be an affront if Gabriel were to become foreign minister. It would also certainly spell the end of a friendship that was already on shaky ground.\n\nSome sources in the SPD say that Schulz should have been more vocal in his pursuit of the nomination. But Schulz wasn't, even though he had ample reason to assume he could have won out over Gabriel. It appears that friendship and loyalty kept him from doing so. These days, however, he is likely to be asking himself whether this friendship still even exists.\n\nAnd if it doesn't? Would Schulz then have every reason to challenge Gabriel and to force a survey of party members? After all, it was Gabriel himself who suggested in a SPIEGEL interview in May that party members should be allowed to vote on who they wanted as their chancellor candidate.","authors":["Hamburg

European Parliament President Martin Schulz said he'll vacate his post and run for a lower house seat in Germany , marking him as one of Chancellor Angela Merkel's potential challengers in next year's election.Schulz, a Social Democrat, has led the European Union 's legislature since 2012. As a senior member of the SPD who's well-known in Germany, he'll be in a strong position as the party prepares to select its candidate for the top of the ticket in January.Merkel's announcement on Sunday that she'll seek a fourth term in 2017 is spurring the Social Democrats, her junior coalition partner, to consider options.Party head Sigmar Gabriel hasn't said whether he'll be the SPD's chancellor candidate and Schulz, 60, is considered a possible alternative.\"More than ever, the world needs a united European Union,\" Schulz told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.\"From now on, I will fight for this project from the national level. Only by doing this will it be possible to regain the lost trust.\"Any SPD candidate will have a steep climb against Merkel, whose Christian Democratic-led bloc leads the Social Democrats by as many as 13 percentage points in national polls.Germany is expected to hold its next national election in September. For now, Schulz's European experience makes him the likeliest candidate to succeed Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat whom Merkel's coalition has proposed as Germany's next president, a largely ceremonial position. A special assembly will elect the president in February.","authors":["Am Ist","Bloomberg Nov"],"feed-id":744,"published":"2016-11-24T18:44:44Z"},{"description":"Brussels (AFP) - Germany's Martin

(AFP) - Germany's Martin Schulz said Thursday he would step down as head of the European Parliament and return to national politics, where speculation grew he could emerge as a challenge to Angela Merkel.\n\nThe outspoken former bookseller will quit in January after four years in office, during which he became one of the European Union's most high-profile politicians and gave its assembly sorely-needed visibility.\n\nThe bearded 60-year-old did not say if he would run for chancellor against Merkel, although he is widely expected to slot into a prime position for the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which is currently in coalition with her.\n\nA key figure of the Brussels establishment, his return to Germany may require a painful reshuffle of the EU's top posts amid deep nervousness over Brexit and the rise of populism in Europe.\n\n\"I will not run as president of the European Parliament for a third term next year, I will run for the German Bundestag (parliament),\" an emotional Schulz told reporters in Brussels.\n\n\"It was not an easy decision, as it is an honour to be the president of the European parliament, said Schulz, who is fluent in German, French, English and Dutch.\n\nSchulz is tipped in Berlin as a possible replacement to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who now leads the party but is behind Schulz in latest polling.\n\nHe is also floated as a possible replacement for Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, another top socialist who is to become Germany's next president.\n\nBut Schulz's departure could trigger a toxic game of musical chairs in the heart of Europe, that might even threaten the positions of European Council chief Donald Tusk and European Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nUnder a long-standing agreement the three top EU posts should not all be held by the same party.\n\nBut the centre-right European People's Party, the largest in the parliament, says it had been promised Schulz's job when his two-year mandate ends on December 31 -- and was already angry that Schulz had been working behind the scenes to stay on.\n\nLast week Schulz even won the support of his friend Juncker, who went against his own EPP party to back the German.\n\nJuncker -- who reportedly said he could resign if the German stepped down -- told reporters on Thursday \"I regret it \" when asked about Schulz's departure.\n\nWith Schulz's exit, the EPP group will now announce their own candidate to head the parliament. Its choice will become a near-certainty for the job.\n\nGroup leader Manfred Weber of Germany, a close ally of Merkel, declined to say whether he would stand himself. Irish deputy parliament chief Mairead McGuinness and France's Alain Lamassoure having also said they will stand for the EPP.\n\nBut Schulz's socialists fired a warning shot, with leader Gianni Pittella saying that \"a right-wing monopoly on the EU institutions would be unacceptable.\"\n\nThat could mean problems for former Polish premier Tusk, an EPP member who took over as head of the European Council, which groups the leaders of the 28 states, in November 2014.\n\nAsked after an EU-Ukraine summit if one of them planned to resign, Juncker joked \"just him\" and gestured toward Tusk. Tusk added: \"Personally and physically I am in quite good shape\".\n\nA dyed-in-the-wool pro-European who once dreamt of being a footballer, Schulz grew up in the aftermath of World War II and ran a bookshop until 1994.\n\nAt 31, he became the youngest ever mayor of Wuerselen, in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous of the German states, and served for 11 years.\n\nHe first hit international headlines in 2003 for facing down a Nazi jibe from Italy's then prime minister Silvio Berlusconi in a European Parliament debate.\n\nBut Schulz will be better remembered in Brussels as what pro-Brexit British MEP Syed Kamall called the \"master of the backroom stitch-up.\"","authors":["On November"],"feed-id":358,"published":"2016-11-24T16:30:00Z"},{"description":"Martin Schulz made the impromptu

Schulz made the impromptu statement at the EU legislature.\n\nThe president of the European Parliament announced on Thursday that he will leave his post and go into German politics, where he could become the main opponent to Chancellor Angela Merkel in next year’s elections.\n\nSPD Socialist Martin Schulz made the impromptu statement at the EU legislature. He has been European Parliament President since 2012 and said that deciding against seeking a third term, “didn’t come easy.” The 28-nation EU has come under increasing pressure since the 2008 economic crisis and Mr. Schulz said “a lot of trust was lost.”\n\nYet, since Germany is ever more the fundamental cornerstone of the EU, Mr. Schulz feels the EU cause can be served from Berlin, too.\n\n“My commitment to the European project is unwavering. From now on I will be fighting for this project from the national level, but my values do not change,” he said.\n\nIn Germany, Mr. Schulz’s SPD is currently a junior partner in the coalition led by Ms. Merkel, who announced last week she would seek a fourth term as chancellor.\n\nThe SDP is badly in need of a strong candidate since Ms. Merkel has reigned supreme in national politics since 2005. Party chairman Sigmar Gabriel still has to decide whether to run against Ms. Merkel, opening the way for Mr. Schulz to make a challenge. Mr. Schulz is a strong speaker, rarely shy to speak his convictions.\n\nThe 60-year-old has been an SPD member for over 40 years and was mayor of Wuerselen, near Aachen in western Germany, before moving to the European Parliament.","authors":["Its Going To Be Brexit Plus Plus Plus President Elect Donald Trump - Or Mr Brexit As He Had Once Referred To Himself Declared Just Days Befo","No Doubt

head of the European Parliament has announced he is going to return to German national politics - and is hotly-tipped to be lining up a campaign to become the country's next Chancellor.\n\nMartin Schulz said today he will be stepping down from his current role.\n\nAlthough he has not confirmed he will stand against Angela Merkel, experts believe he will return to a prime position for the Social Democratic Party (SDP).\n\nHe told reporters in Brussels: 'I will not run as president of the European parliament for a third term next year, I will run for the German Bundestag as the head of the list of my party, the SPD, in North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\n'It was not an easy decision, as it is an honour to be the president of the European parliament.'\n\nSchulz, who has led the assembly since 2012, added: 'Throughout my time in European Parliament... I have strived to strengthen the credibility and visibility of European politics.'\n\nHe continued: 'My commitment to the EU project is unwavering. From now I will be fighting for this project from a national level. But my values do not change.'\n\nVice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel now leads the SDP, but he is grappling with poor popularity ratings.\n\nSchulz is also tipped as a possible replacement for Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, another top socialist who is bidding to become Germany's next president.\n\nThe former bookseller from Aachen in Germany who once dreamt of being a footballer is probably best known for facing down a Nazi jibe from Italy's then prime minister Silvio Berlusconi in a European Parliament debate.\n\nBerlusconi suggested that Schulz would be perfectly cast as a Nazi concentration camp guard after the latter heckled the former Italian Prime Minister.\n\nThe remark sparked uproar in the chamber and caused a diplomatic crisis between Italy and Germany.\n\nTo loud applause, he criticised Berlusconi for 'losing his manners' and for joking about concentration camps.\n\nHis imminent departure raises questions over the future of European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who reportedly said if Schulz was forced out 'then I cannot guarantee my future as commission president', according to Der Spiegel.","authors":["Dave Burke For Mailonline"],"feed-id":73,"published":"2016-11-24T11:33:42Z"}]}
